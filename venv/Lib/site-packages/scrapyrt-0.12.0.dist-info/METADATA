Introduction
============

HTTP server which provides API for scheduling `Scrapy <https://scrapy.org/>`_ spiders and
making requests with spiders.

Features
========
* Allows you to easily add HTTP API to your existing Scrapy project
* All Scrapy project components (e.g. middleware, pipelines, extensions) are supported out of the box. 
* You simply run Scrapyrt in Scrapy project directory and it starts HTTP server allowing you to schedule your spiders and get spider output in JSON format.

Note
====
* Project is not a replacement for `Scrapyd <https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ or `Scrapy Cloud <https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/>`_ or other infrastructure to run long running crawls
* Not suitable for long running spiders, good for spiders that will fetch one response from some website and return response

Getting started
===============

To install Scrapyrt::

    pip install scrapyrt

Now you can run Scrapyrt from within Scrapy project by just typing::

    scrapyrt

in Scrapy project directory.

Scrapyrt will look for ``scrapy.cfg`` file to determine your project settings,
and will raise error if it won't find one.  Note that you need to have all
your project requirements installed.

Scrapyrt supports endpoint ``/crawl.json`` that can be requested
with two methods: GET and POST.

To run sample toscrape-css spider from `Quotesbot <https://github.com/scrapy/quotesbot>`_
parsing page about famous quotes::

    curl "http://localhost:9080/crawl.json?spider_name=toscrape-css&url=http://quotes.toscrape.com/"


To run same spider only allowing one request and parsing url
with callback ``parse_foo``::

    curl "http://localhost:9080/crawl.json?spider_name=toscrape-css&url=http://quotes.toscrape.com/&callback=parse_foo&max_requests=1"
